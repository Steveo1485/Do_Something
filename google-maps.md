Google Maps may not be best choice for app. We don't require addresses, only cities.

Google Places may be better.

Nearby Search - https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/search

Uses following form: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/output?parameters

Where output can be json or xml. Use json!

Paramters can be:
key - your API key
location - MUST BE LATITUDE/LONGITUDE

Not a good option since we don't have latitude/longitude information.
